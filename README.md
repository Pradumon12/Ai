 # Installation 
Here are step-by-step instructions to install and use the Friday tool:

**Install Python:** If you don't already have Python installed on your computer, go to the official Python website (python.org) and download the latest version for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions to complete the installation.

**Install Required Modules:** The Friday tool relies on several Python modules that you will need to install. To do so, open a command prompt or terminal window and run the following commands:

Copy code
```
pip install speechrecognition
pip install pyttsx3
pip install openai
```
These commands will install the speechrecognition, pyttsx3, and openai modules on your computer.

**Get an OpenAI API Key:** To use the OpenAI API, you will need to sign up for an API key on the OpenAI website ![openai.com.](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) Once you have signed up, you can copy the API key to the clipboard.

**Replace the API Key:** In the code you provided, replace the "openai.api_key" value with your own API key that you obtained in Step 3.

**Run the Code:** Save the code in a file named "friday.py" or any other name you prefer, then run it from a command prompt or terminal window using the command "python friday.py". The program will start listening to your voice and responding with text generated by the OpenAI API.

**Speak to the Tool:** Once the program is running, you can start speaking to the tool by saying anything you like. The tool will respond with text generated by the OpenAI API. To exit the program, say "exit".

That's it! You should now be able to use the Friday tool on your computer.
